Pod Bay Doors
=============
### Open the pod bay doors, HAL.

Pod Bay Doors is a simple bit of Javascript and jQuery that does just what it sounds like, opens up some divs as if they were some pod bay doors. Nothing much going on behind the scenes, just some CSS positioning of the elements (two divs inside a container div that hides the overflow) and some jQuery to animate everything. 

I've included [jQuery Easing](http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/) so that we aren't stuck with jQuery's swing all of the time. 

I eventually plan on making it a proper jQuery plugin with some options that you can pass in, but I just wanted to get a working version going right now.
